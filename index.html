							<h2>From molecular diffusion dynamics to cellular function and beyond
							</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I am a biochemist by training and excited to understand how molecular motion of bio-molecules translates to biological function across scales. It is utterly fascinating that the nano-scale interaction of only a few proteins such as transmembrane receptors binding their to ligands or transcription factors binding to DNA, can completely reshape the structure and function of a cell and even impact on whole tissues and organisms. To study these processes, I employ a variety of imaging, spectroscopy and molecular biology tools as well as <i>in vitro</i> model membrane systems, cell culture models, and animal models. Ultimately, I build tools and aim to answer fundamental questions about the dynamic organization of biological systems from the bottom up. </p>

								<h3><u>Advancing fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy</u></h3>
								<p>Fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS) and especially fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) are commonly employed tools to study diffusion dynamics and changes in concentrations or oligomeric states. My research focuses on the application and further development of FCS in conjunction with super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy. STED-FCS enables to measure diffusion dynamics directly on the nano-scale and even allows to map hindrances in diffusion (for example binding sites) across space. While STED-FCS provides unchallenged resolution for fluctuation spectroscopy, it requires special hardware. To make the nano-scale diffusion measurements more accessible, I work on confocal scanning FCS (sFCS) pipelines exploiting statistical tricks to access hidden dynamics in the measured ensemble. Currently, I am focussing my efforts to enable the detection of oligomerisation using sFCS. </p>

								<h3><u>Plasma membrane organisation & signalling</u></h3>
								<p>The cellular plasma membrane is composed of thousands of lipids and proteins. It acts as a signalling platform bringing molecules together or keeping them apart. The fluid nature of the membrane makes it a powerful cellular organizer. Dynamic techniques such as FCS can be applied to follow changes in, for example, lipid or receptor organization. Thus far, my research has focused on the impact of the actin cytoskeleton on the membrane organization and how FCS based methods can be used to reveal cellular activation in the context of immune cells. To study membrane organization, I routinely employ model membrane systems of different complexity such as supported lipid bilayers (SLBs), giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs), and cellular plasma membranes. More recently, I started to study membrane organization in the developing zebra fish embryo. </p>

								<h3><u>Biophysical imaging with smart probes</u></h3>
								<p>Cells are heterogeneous in their structure and organization: liquid condensates in the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm or nano-domain formation in the plasma membrane display only a small subset of possible means for the cell to compartmentalize signalling molecules. While measurements of diffusion dynamics can be used to infer organization, they are limited in spatial coverage. Smart probes, so called environment sensitive probes, overcome this issue. They can be used in imaging modality (with a large field of view) and change a certain fluorescence property according to the environment. For example, solvatochormic probes can report on lipid packing by a change in emission spectrum and can even be used in conjunction with super-resolution STED imaging. Another example is the Flipper probe that can report on membrane tension and is read out by changes in fluorescence lifetime. Recently, I have focussed on the use of the Flipper probe in <i>in vivo</i> settings such as mouse and zebra fish embryos and established that the dye can be efficiently used in conjunction with two-photon excitation. In addition, I have established the use of the Phasor analysis to aid visualisation of tension differneces. </p>

								<h3><u>Studying molecular interactions in physiological context</u></h3>
								<p>Fundamental biological processes, including signal transduction, cellular differentiation, and cell migration, hinge upon single molecule interactions within living systems. Yet, these interactions are often studied in isolated conditions, such as using reconstituted proteins in solution or transfected cells in culture. To delve into more intricate biological questions, it is essential to investigate these interactions within the full physiological context, specifically within tissues and whole organisms. My recent research focuses on utilizing zebra fish as a model system to explore the influence of protein and nucleic acid interactions on early development. I employ standard and advanced molecular biology techniques for genetic modifications and have initiated the optimization of fluorescence fluctuation approaches and fluorescent probes for <i>in vivo</i> applications. This effort is geared towards enabling the observation of single molecule interactions using readily available instrumentation, facilitating the investigation of cellular signaling networks in developing tissues.  </p>

						<h4>My story in a few words</h4>
						<p> <span class="image left"><img src="images/Hannover.jpg" alt="Leibniz University Hannover" /></span> <u><b>Bachelor and Master Studies in Hanover </b></u>
							<br>In 2010, I started my scientific journey with the admission to the biochemistry program at the Leibniz University in Hanover, Germany. Choosing a field of study for the undergrad was quite challenging as I had a broad interest in natural sciences and math but also felt that the application and translation of basic science were important. The biochemistry program in Hanover was a collaboration between University and Medical school aiming to provide a broad basic science education combined with the prospect of medical applications, so it was a great fit for me. In addition, I had the chance to enjoy the life in a vibrant city offering a great mix of music scenes, history, and nature. <br>
						Throughout my studies and first lab experiences, I gained more and more interest in the phenomenon and application of fluorescence. The shear possibility of detecting a single molecule blew my mind and still amazes me. For my Bachelor thesis, I worked on the development of an inorganic phosphate sensor using microscale thermophoresis. During my master studies, I focused on biophysical chemistry and microscopy. I joined <a href="https://www.biophysical-imaging.com/" target = "_blank">Christian Eggeling’s lab</a> for a three-month internship at the University of Oxford which set the stage for my PhD. I was intrigued by the research and the upcoming field of super-resolution microscopy and spectroscopy. For my master thesis project, I joined <a href="https://www.joerg-enderlein.de//" target = "_blank">Joerg Enderlein’s lab</a> at the University of Göttingen which allowed me to learn more about spectroscopy and data analysis.
						<br> 
						<span class="image right"><img src="images/Oxford_smaller.jpg" alt="Radcliffe camera University of Oxford" /></span> <u><b>PhD studies at Oxford </b></u>
							<br>I started my PhD at University of Oxford in the Eggeling Lab in October 2015. My project was based around the application of fluorescence fluctuation based methods in conjunction with super-resolution STED microscopy to shed light on the plasma membrane organization during T-cell activation. The Weatherall Institute for Molecular Medicine (WIMM) was the perfect place for the project because it brings together immunologists, cell biologists and microscopists. I thoroughly enjoyed the open and collaborative environment in the lab and building. I helped funding the Weatherall Graduate Student Association (<a href="https://www.imm.ox.ac.uk/study-with-us/wimm-graduate-student-association" target = "_blank">WGSA</a>) through which we organized frequently scientific and social events to further connect the student body. <br>
							 <u><b>Postdoctoral work at Oxford and USC </b></u>
							<br>
						I defended my PhD in January 2020. While the Eggeling lab had moved to Jena, Germany, in 2018, I stayed for a transition postdoc in the <a href="https://www.bpi-oxford.com/" target = "_blank">Fritzsche Lab for Biophysical Immunology</a> at the Kennedy Institute (University of Oxford). This allowed me to learn more about biomechanics and gave me time to conclude some projects from my PhD. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, I could move to the US in May 2021 and started in Scott Fraser’s lab in the <a href="https://www.bpi-oxford.com/" target = "_blank">Translational Imaging Center (TIC)</a> at the University of Southern California (USC). Currently, I am taking on the challenge of translating my quantitative imaging and spectroscopy tools to measurements <i>in vivo</i>, in zebrafish embryos, while also embracing life in Los Angeles.
